# Password-Classifier
Project created for Cybersecurity lectures. The goal was examination of randomness of passwords with differents lenghts and strenghts (desribed as number 0,1,2 where 0 is the weakest and 2 is the strongest password). Data was from kaggle but unfurtunately it was deleted from the site. Techniques used in this project: 
1. Natural Language Processing - transofrming password using TfidfVectorizer
2. Supervised Machine Learning - classification of password strenghts using RandomForestClassifier with accuracy = 98%
